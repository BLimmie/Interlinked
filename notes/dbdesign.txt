Will include _id attr., not for authentication / insert but for referencing
providers / patients as foreign keys  
Salt will be added later, password will be hashed ofc.
For now patient schema is: 
{ "_id" , "name" , "username", "password", "providers { _id, name, username }", "salt" }
For now providers schema is: 
{ "_id" , "name" , "username", "password", "patients { _id, name, username }", "salt" }
Username is unique among all patients and providers. In the future may reference
videos.
For now sessions schema is: 
{ "_id" , "link" , "patient { _id, name, username } ", "provider { _id, name, username }", "createdtime" }
link and (patient and provider) are keys
Potential videos schema is:
{ "_id" , "location", "timestamp", "duration", "patient", "provider" }
providers and patients will be a list of ObjectId()
Sessions will use patient provider _id in case username not unique.
In general try to use id for queries, since username / other info can change
so it's annoying to try to change the data throughout the db if we use other
info to reference  

We could reference sessions in users documents, but that means when adding /
removing a session we must update the users. However as is we must search in
the sessions collection to provide links for users, which could be slow (read
is slower, write is faster).

We will reference videos in users. This allows other people to access the
video besides the patient and provider. But we also have the same issue with
sessions in that for the main actors of the videos we may want to reference
them (or not) directly in their documents. It's probably ok since videos
should not be updated as much as sessions, so write won't be too slow.

For now we will not reference sessions but reference videos (in the future).

To authenticate user on login: 
`db.providers.find({username: "Username", password: "Password"})` 

To authenticate/find user:
`db.providers.find({_id: ObjectId("sdfsfsdfsdfsd")})` 

To create user:
`db.providers.insertOne({"name": x, "username": y, "password": z})`

To modify username:
`db.patients.update({_id: ObjectId("sdfsfsdfsdfsd")}, {$set: {username: "Username"}})`
Instead of updating all matches we could just get the list of providers from
the patient doc and update them
`db.providers.update({"patients._id": ObjectId("5db63380d635f34ac9e355e3")}, {$set: {"patients.$.username": "username"}})`
`db.sessions.update({"patient._id": ObjectId("5db63380d635f34ac9e355e3")}, {$set: {"patient.username": "username"}})`

To add user to associated users (should do for both the provider and patient, only provider should add):
`db.patients.update({_id: ObjectId("blahblah")}, {$addToSet: {providers: {_id: ObjectId("sdfsdfsdfsdf"), name: "name", username: "Username"}}})`
`db.providers.update({_id: ObjectId("sdfsdfsdfsdf")}, {$addToSet: {patients: {_id: ObjectId("blahblah"), name: "name", username: "Username"}}})`

To remove a patient/provider of a user:
`db.providers.update({username: "Who"}, {$pull: {patients: {_id: ObjectId("blahblah")}}})`

To remove all patients/providers of a user:
`db.providers.update({_id: ObjectId("5db62c3cd635f34ac9e355e2")}, {$unset: {patients: ""}})`

To delete a user permanently:
Delete all references in either patients or providers so call remove a patient
for all entities containing the deleted user.
We could match all users that refer to deleted user or use deleted users list
to remove their references. Since we would have to create a complicated filter
or query to update each reference, for now we will updatemany anyone who
matches.
Then delete all sessions.
`db.providers.update({patients._id: ObjectId("blahblah")}, {$pull: {patients: {_id: ObjectId("blahblah")}}})`
`db.patients.update({providers._id: ObjectId("blahblah")}, {$pull: {providers: {_id: ObjectId("blahblah")}}})`
`db.sessions.update({provider._id: ObjectId("blahblah")}, {$pull: {provider: {_id: ObjectId("blahblah")}}})`

To create session (verify valid patient beforehand):
`db.sessions.insert({"link": x, "patient": {id, username}, "provider": {id, username}, "exp": time})`

To remove session (query should be scheduled or processed every insert):
`db.sessions.remove({exp : {$gt : currentTime}})`
