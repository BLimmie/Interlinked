OAuth: for providing only necessary functionality / information to services,
it would be nice if there's some service with patient/ doctor information
with oauth but unlikely ; used for authorizing users to do certain things   
OpenID: use an identity provider in order to verify account, means we don't
have to store and protect passwords, but maybe not a good idea for an
application with important information / use? For mvp it's probably ok ; used
to authenticate users

Storing passwords by ourselves, but that means we need to salt and hash
passwords and manage a way to authorize users during requests
